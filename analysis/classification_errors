+1    43    3597357   -0.16   Short chain acyl-CoA (SCA), medium chain acyl-CoA (MCA), and isovaleryl-CoA (IV) dehydrogenases were purified to homogeneity from human liver using ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by DEAE-Sephadex A-50, hydroxyapatite, Matrex Gel Blue A, agarose-hexane-CoA, and Bio-Gel A-0.5 column chromatographies. The specific activities of the final preparations were enriched 507-, 750-, and 588-fold over those from the second ammonium sulfate fractionation step. The native molecular weights were estimated to be 168,000, 178,000, and 172,000, respectively, by gel filtration. Each of them exhibited, on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a single protein band with molecular weights of 41,000, 44,000, and 42,000, respectively, indicating a homotetrameric structure. UV/visual spectra, fluorescence spectra, and other evidence indicated that each contains 1 mol of FAD per subunit. They all utilized electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) or phenazine methosulfate (PMS) as an electron acceptor. The products of SCA dehydrogenase/butyryl-CoA, MCA dehydrogenase/octanoyl-CoA, and IV dehydrogenase/isovaleryl-CoA reactions were identified as crotonyl-CoA, 2-octenoyl-CoA, and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, respectively, using gas chromatography. Kinetic parameters Vappmax and Kappm) of these enzymes for various acyl-CoA substrates, as well as Kappm values for ETF and PMS are presented. In general, the substrate specificities of human SCA, MCA, and IV dehydrogenases are slightly less stringent than those of their rat counterparts and resemble those of their bovine and porcine counterparts. The pattern of substrate specificity for these enzymes determined using ETF as electron acceptor significantly differed from that determined using PMS. All of them were severely inhibited by (methylenecyclopropyl)acetyl-CoA.

+1    157    10572067   -0.0086   This article examines differential expression and heterodimer formation of ErbB family members in tumorigenic and nontumorigenic human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). This cell system was developed previously as a model for lung adenocarcinoma by overexpression of c-erbB-2 in nontumorigenic, T antigen-immortalized HBECs. Earlier studies demonstrated that a tumorigenic clone from T antigen-immortalized nontumorigenic cells overexpressing ErbB-2 endogenously produced high levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, and that reducing TGF-alpha by 93% eliminated tumorigenicity. In the present report, comparison of ErbB species between the tumorigenic cells (E6T) and their nontumorigenic derivatives (E6TA) demonstrated all four receptors in both cell types. However, in E6TA cells, ErbB-3 and -4 were present primarily in ErbB-1 heterodimers, suggesting that ErbB-1 is a preferred heterodimer partner within this cell system, expressing endogenous ErbB receptors and ligands and overexpressing ErbB-2. The ErbB-1/-2 species was present at high levels in E6T and absent in E6TA cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was elevated in E6T relative to E6TA. Elevated activity was eliminated by blocking surface expression of either ErbB-1 or ErbB-2. Endoplasmic reticulum trapping of ErbB-1 eliminated tumorigenicity, whereas ErbB-2 internalization was selected against during tumor formation. These data demonstrate the importance of TGF-alpha-mediated signaling through the ErbB-1/-2 heterodimer in development of the tumorigenic phenotype. This work further suggests that ErbB-3 and -4 species may also contribute to tumorigenic conversion and that their expression levels may be increased by signaling initiated by TGF-alpha.

+1    160    2722838   -0.41   Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase catalyzes the final step in proline synthesis by NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of pyrroline-5-carboxylate. We have purified and characterized this enzyme from human erythrocytes. Purification to homogeneity (approximately 600,000-fold) was accomplished by sonication, ultracentrifugation, 2',5'-ADP-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography. The enzyme runs as a single band of 30,000 Mr on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sizing chromatography under nondenaturating conditions demonstrates activity in the 300,000-350,000 Mr range, suggesting that the native enzyme exists as a 10- to 12-mer. The purified enzyme exhibits kinetic characteristics similar to those previously described for whole red cell homogenates. The Vmax is 10-fold higher and the Km for pyrroline-5-carboxylate is 7-fold higher with NADH versus NADPH as cofactor. The affinity for NADPH is 15-fold higher than that for NADH. Erythrocyte pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is competitively inhibited by NADP+. Unlike the enzyme from some other sources, erythrocyte pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is not inhibited by proline or ATP. Double label studies using [14C]pyrroline-5-carboxylate and [3H]exNADPH in the presence of both NADH and NADPH were performed to determine the preferred source of reducing equivalents. In the presence of physiologic concentrations of pyrroline-5-carboxylate and both pyridine nucleotides, all of the reducing equivalents came from NADPH. We suggest that, in some cell types including human erythrocytes, a physiologic function of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is the generation of NADP+.

+1    169    8641281    -0.22   A covalent stoichiometric complex between photosystem I (PSI) and ferredoxin from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was generated by chemical cross-linking. The photoreduction of ferredoxin, studied by laser flash absorption spectroscopy between 460 and 600 nm, is a fast process in 60% of the covalent complexes, which exhibit spectral and kinetic properties very similar to those observed with the free partners. Two major phases with t(1/2) <1 micros and approximately 10-14 micros are observed at two different pH values (5.8 and 8.0). The remaining complexes do not undergo fast ferredoxin reduction and 20-25% of the complexes are still able to reduce free ferredoxin or flavodoxin efficiently, thus indicating that ferredoxin is not bound properly in this proportion of covalent complexes. The docking site of ferredoxin on PSI was determined by electron microscopy in combination with image analysis. Ferredoxin binds to the cytoplasmic side of PSI, with its mass center 77 angstroms distant from the center of the trimer and in close contact with a ridge formed by the subunits PsaC, PsaD and PsaE. This docking site corresponds to a close proximity between the [2Fe- 2S] center of ferredoxin and the terminal [4Fe-4S] acceptor FII of PSI and is very similar in position to the docking site of flavodoxin, an alternative electron acceptor of PSI.

+1    190    1000867   -0.93   A method for the determination of manganese in blood and urine is described. A chelate fo manganese with cupferron is extracted with methylisobutylketone and determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The method is directly applicable to urine but the determination of manganese in blood required a preliminary digestion step. With the use of internal standards, this technique allows the determination of manganese concentrations of the order of 1 mug/1 of urine or 1 mug/100 ml whole blood.

+1    349    10486928    -0.78   This brief review deals with the effect of diva (Differentiating Infected from VAccinated individuals) vaccines (also termed marker vaccines) on transmission of herpesviruses and pestiviruses in swine and cattle. Pseudorabies and bovine herpesvirus 1 diva vaccines have been demonstrated to reduce transmission of wild-type virus in populations of pigs and cattle in the laboratory as well as in the field. A subunit diva vaccine based on the immunodominant E2 protein of classical swine fever virus that is expressed in the baculovirus system may reduce transmission of wild-type virus among pigs and also transmission from mother to foetuses. A similar diva vaccine against bovine virus diarrhoea infections protected sheep against transplacental transmission of antigenically homologous wild-type virus. Diva vaccines along with their companion diagnostic tests can play a role in control of infections, ultimately leading to eradication of viruses.

-1    480    6389132    0.53     The conformations of the ribotrinucleoside bisphosphates GpApC and GpApU, the codon and wobble codon for aspartic acid respectively, bound to yeast tRNAAsp in solution, have been examined by means of time-dependent transferred nuclear Overhauser enhancement measurements to determine distances between bound ligand protons The conformations of the two bound ribotrinucleoside bisphosphates are shown to be very similar with an overall root-mean-square difference in interproton distances of 0.03 nm The ribose conformations of all the residues are 3'-endo; the glycosidic bond torsion angles of the A and C residues of GpApC and of the A and U residues of GpApU are in the low anti range These features are typical of an A-RNA type structure In contrast, the G residue of both GpApC and GpApU exists as a mixture of syn and anti conformations The overall conformation of the two bound ribotrinucleoside bisphosphates is also similar to A-RNA and the stability of the complexes is enhanced by extensive base-base stacking interactions In addition, it is shown that the binding of the codon GpApC to tRNAAsp induces self-association into a multicomplex system consisting of four GpApC-tRNAAsp complexes, whereas the wobble codon GpApU fails to induce any observable self-association.
     
-1    481    12753076    0.02   The present study was designed to investigate the effect of repeated administration of a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist (1S-trans)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]-benzenea cetamide hydrochloride [(-)U-50,488H] on antinociception and G-protein activation induced by mu-opioid receptor agonists in mice A single s.c injection of (-)U-50,488H produced a dose-dependent antinociception, and this effect was reversed by a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) Furthermore, a single s.c pre-treatment with (-)U-50,488H had no effect on the mu-opioid receptor agonist-induced antinociception In contrast, repeated s.c administration of (-)U-50,488H resulted in the development of tolerance to (-)U-50,488H-induced antinociception Under these conditions, we demonstrated here that repeated s.c injection of (-)U-50,488H significantly enhanced the antinociceptive effect of selective mu-opioid receptor agonists endomorphin-1, endomorphin-2 and [d-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly-ol5] enkephalin (DAMGO) Using the guanosine-5'-o-(3-[35S]thio) triphosphate ([35S]GTP gamma S) binding assay, we found that (-)U-50,488H was able to produce a nor-BNI-reversible increase in [35S]GTP gamma S binding to membranes of the mouse thalamus, which has a high level of kappa-opioid receptors Repeated administration of (-)U-50,488H caused a significant reduction in the (-)U-50,488H-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding in this region, whereas chronic treatment with (-)U-50,488H exhibited the increase in the endomorphin-1-, endomorphin-2- and DAMGO-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S bindings in membranes of the thalamus and periaqueductal gray These results suggest that repeated stimulation of kappa-opioid receptors leads to the heterologous up-regulation of mu-opioid receptor functions in the thalamus and periaqueductal gray regions, which may be associated with the supersensitivity of mu-opioid receptor-mediated antinociception.

-1    482    8730858    0.51    Like other microorganisms, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to starvation by arresting growth and entering stationary phase Because most microorganisms exist under conditions of nutrient limitation, the ability to tolerate starvation is critical for survival Molecular analyses have identified changes in transcription, translation, and protein modification in stationary-phase cells At the level of translation, the pattern of newly synthesized proteins in stationary-phase cells is surprisingly similar to the pattern of proteins synthesized during exponential growth When limited for different nutrients, yeast strains may not enter stationary phase but opt for pathways such as pseudohyphal growth If nutrient limitation continues, the end-point is likely to be a stationary-phase cell Based on the results of recent studies, we propose a model for entry into stationary phase in which G(o) arrest is separable from acquisition of the ability to survive long periods of time without added nutrients.

-1    594    12408822    0.28   In Drosophila, two features of small interfering RNA (siRNA) structure--5' phosphates and 3' hydroxyls--are reported to be essential for RNA interference (RNAi) Here, we show that as in Drosophila, a 5' phosphate is required for siRNA function in human HeLa cells In contrast, we find no evidence in flies or humans for a role in RNAi for the siRNA 3' hydroxyl group Our in vitro data suggest that in both flies and mammals, each siRNA guides endonucleolytic cleavage of the target RNA at a single site We conclude that the underlying mechanism of RNAi is conserved between flies and mammals and that RNA-dependent RNA polymerases are not required for RNAi in these organisms.
